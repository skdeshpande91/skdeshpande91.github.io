@article{2024-11-14-flexBART,
	abstract = {Most implementations of Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) one-hot encode categorical predictors, replacing each one with several binary indicators, one for every level or category. Regression trees built with these indicators partition the discrete set of categorical levels by repeatedly removing one level at a time. Unfortunately, the vast majority of partitions cannot be built with this strategy, severely limiting BART's ability to partially pool data across groups of levels. Motivated by analyses of baseball data and neighborhood-level crime dynamics, we overcame this limitation by re-implementing BART with regression trees that can assign multiple levels to both branches of a decision tree node. To model spatial data aggregated into small regions, we further proposed a new decision rule prior that creates spatially contiguous regions by deleting a random edge from a random spanning tree of a suitably defined network. Our re-implementation, which is available in the flexBART package, often yields improved out-of-sample predictive performance and scales better to larger datasets than existing implementations of BART.},

@article{2024-09-24-vcbart,
	abstract = {The linear varying coefficient models posits a linear relationship between an outcome and covariates in which the covariate effects are modeled as functions of additional effect modifiers. Despite a long history of study and use in statistics and econometrics, state-of-the-art varying coefficient modeling methods cannot accommodate multivariate effect modifiers without imposing restrictive functional form assumptions or involving computationally intensive hyperparameter tuning. In response, we introduce VCBART, which flexibly estimates the covariate effect in a varying coefficient model using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. With simple default settings, VCBART outperforms existing varying coefficient methods in terms of covariate effect estimation, uncertainty quantification, and outcome prediction. We illustrate the utility of VCBART with two case studies: one examining how the association between later-life cognition and measures of socioeconomic position vary with respect to age and socio-demographics and another estimating how temporal trends in urban crime vary at the neighborhood level. An R package implementing VCBART is available at [this url](https://github.com/skdeshpande91/VCBART)},

@article{2024-04-25-cvalues,
	abstract = {Modern statistics provides an ever-expanding toolkit for estimating unknown parameters. Consequently, applied statisticians frequently face a difficult decision: retain a parameter estimate from a familiar method or replace it with an estimate from a newer or more complex one. While it is traditional to compare estimates using risk, such comparisons are rarely conclusive in realistic settings. In response, we propose the ``c-value'' as a measure of confidence that a new estimate achieves smaller loss than an old estimate on a given dataset. We show that it is unlikely that a large c-value coincides with a larger loss for the new estimate. Therefore, just as a small p-value supports rejecting a null hypothesis, a large c-value supports using a new estimate in place of the old. For a wide class of problems and estimates, we show how to compute a c-value by first constructing a data-dependent high-probability lower bound on the difference in loss. The c-value is frequentist in nature, but we show that it can provide validation of shrinkage estimates derived from Bayesian models in real data applications involving hierarchical models and Gaussian processes.
