	abstract = {Expected points is a value function fundamental to player evaluation and strategic in-game decision-making across sports analytics, particularly in American football. To estimate expected points, football analysts use machine learning tools, which are not equipped to handle certain challenges. They suffer from selection bias, display counter-intuitive artifacts of overfitting, do not quantify uncertainty in point estimates, and do not account for the strong dependence structure of observational football data. These issues are not unique to American football or even sports analytics; they are general problems analysts encounter across various statistical applications, particularly when using machine learning in lieu of traditional statistical models. We explore these issues in detail and devise expected points models that account for them. We also introduce a widely applicable novel methodological approach to mitigate overfitting, using a catalytic prior to smooth our machine learning models.},

	abstract = {Estimating varying treatment effects in randomized trials with noncompliance is inherently challenging since variation comes from two separate sources: variation in the impact itself and variation in the compliance rate. In this setting, existing frequentist and flexible machine learning methods are highly sensitive to the weak instruments problem, in which the compliance rate is (locally) close to zero. Bayesian approaches, on the other hand, can naturally account for noncompliance via imputation. We propose a Bayesian machine learning approach that combines the best features of both approaches. Our main methodological contribution is to present a Bayesian Causal Forest model for binary response variables in scenarios with noncompliance by repeatedly imputing individuals' compliance types, allowing us to flexibly estimate varying treatment effects among compliers. Simulation studies demonstrate the usefulness of our approach when compliance and treatment effects are heterogeneous. We apply the method to detect and analyze heterogeneity in the treatment effects in the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study, which not only features heterogeneous and one-sided compliance but also several binary outcomes of interest. We demonstrate the methodology on three outcomes one year after intervention. We confirm a null effect on the presence of a chronic condition, discover meaningful heterogeneity in a "bad health" outcome that cancels out to null in classical partial effect estimates, and find substantial heterogeneity in individuals' perception of management prioritization of health and safety.},
